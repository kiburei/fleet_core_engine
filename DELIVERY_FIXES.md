# Delivery System Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Admin Assign Driver Not Working ✅

**Problem:** 
- Clicking "Assign Driver" link didn't work because there was no view to select a driver
- The controller action expected `driver_id` but the link just went to a GET route with no form

**Solution:**
- Created `app/views/admin/delivery_requests/assign_driver.html.erb` view
- Shows list of available drivers with their details:
  - Name, phone, rating, total deliveries
  - Distance to pickup location
  - Vehicle information
  - "Assign" button for each driver
- Updated `Admin::DeliveryRequestsController#assign_driver` to handle both GET and PATCH requests:
  - GET: Shows the driver selection page
  - PATCH: Assigns the selected driver

**Usage:**
1. Go to delivery request details page
2. Click "Assign Driver" button
3. Select from list of available drivers
4. Click "Assign" button next to chosen driver

### 2. Drivers Not Seeing Deliveries on Vue App ✅

**Problem:**
- API was crashing when trying to return delivery data if `marketplace_order` was nil
- Line 295-300 in `Api::V1::DeliveryRequestsController` accessed `marketplace_order` properties without null check

**Solution:**
- Fixed `delivery_request_data` method to safely handle nil marketplace_order:
  ```ruby
  marketplace_order: delivery.marketplace_order ? {
    id: delivery.marketplace_order.id,
    order_number: delivery.marketplace_order.order_number,
    total_amount: delivery.marketplace_order.total_amount,
    total_items: delivery.marketplace_order.total_items
  } : nil
  ```

**API Endpoints for Vue App:**
The following endpoints are now working correctly:

1. **Get Driver's Assigned Deliveries:**
   ```
   GET /api/v1/delivery_requests
   Headers: Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>
   ```

2. **Get Available Deliveries (for driver to accept):**
   ```
   GET /api/v1/delivery_requests/available
   Headers: Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>
   ```

3. **Accept Delivery:**
   ```
   PATCH /api/v1/delivery_requests/:id/accept
   Headers: Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>
   ```

4. **Get Driver Status:**
   ```
   GET /api/v1/delivery_requests/driver_status
   Headers: Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>
   ```

## Vue App Integration Guide

### Authentication
The Vue app needs to:
1. Login via `POST /api/v1/auth/login` with driver credentials
2. Store the JWT token received
3. Send token in Authorization header for all API requests

### Real-time Updates
Drivers receive real-time delivery notifications via ActionCable WebSocket:

**Subscribe to driver channel:**
```javascript
// Connect to ActionCable
const cable = ActionCable.createConsumer('ws://your-server/cable')

// Subscribe to driver's channel
const driverChannel = cable.subscriptions.create(
  { channel: 'DriverLocationChannel', driver_id: driverId },
  {
    received(data) {
      if (data.type === 'new_delivery_available') {
        // Show notification to driver
        // data.delivery_request contains delivery details
      }
    }
  }
)
```

### Required Environment Variables for Vue App
```
VUE_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://your-backend-url
VUE_APP_WS_URL=ws://your-backend-url/cable
```

## Testing the Fixes

### Test Admin Assign Driver:
1. Start Rails server: `rails server`
2. Login as admin
3. Go to Admin → Delivery Requests
4. Click on a pending delivery
5. Click "Assign Driver"
6. Select a driver and click "Assign"

### Test Driver API:
```bash
# 1. Login as driver
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "driver@example.com", "password": "password"}'

# 2. Get available deliveries (replace TOKEN with JWT from login)
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/v1/delivery_requests/available \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN"

# 3. Get assigned deliveries
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/v1/delivery_requests \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN"
```

## Vue App Location

**Note:** The Vue app is NOT in this repository. It should be in a separate repository (e.g., `fleet_driver_app` or similar).

If you can't find the Vue app:
1. Check for a separate frontend repository
2. Look in parent directory: `ls -la /Users/kiburei/Development/`
3. Check for mobile apps (React Native, Flutter, etc.)

The backend API is complete and working. The issue was the API crashing due to nil marketplace_order.

## Additional Notes

### Driver Requirements to See Deliveries:
1. Driver must have a user account with `fleet_provider_driver` role
2. Driver must be authenticated (have valid JWT token)
3. For "available deliveries": Driver must be online (`is_online: true`)
4. Driver location must be within delivery radius (check `max_delivery_distance_km`)

### Troubleshooting Vue App:
If drivers still can't see deliveries:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify API endpoint URLs are correct
3. Confirm JWT token is being sent in headers
4. Check driver is online in database: `Driver.find(id).is_online`
5. Verify deliveries exist: `DeliveryRequest.unassigned.count`
6. Check CORS configuration in `config/initializers/cors.rb`
